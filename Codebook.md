## Codebook for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
Heather Wade

This Codebook describes every step have done in order to achieve the project's aim which wants to generate a tidy dataset.

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on 
a series of yes/no questions related to the project. 
You will be required to submit: 
1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. 

## Step by Step

## 1. Souce Datasets
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

## Activity Labels.
* `WALKING` (value `1`): subject was walking during the test
* `WALKING_UPSTAIRS` (value `2`): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
* `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS` (value `3`): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
* `SITTING` (value `4`): subject was sitting during the test
* `STANDING` (value `5`): subject was standing during the test
* `LAYING` (value `6`): subject was laying down during the test

### Step 1. Loading training and the test sets to create one data set (i.e. loading datasets and cleaning them).
After setting the source directory for the files, read into tables the data located in
- features.txt
- activity_labels.txt
- subject_train.txt
- x_train.txt
- y_train.txt
- subject_test.txt
- x_test.txt
- y_test.txt

## Step 2. Selecting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
In order to prepare features only for mean and standard deviation, a logical vector was create with TRUE values for the ID, mean and stdev columns and FALSE values for the others. Here, data were subset to have the required columns. Besides, the gsub function was used for replacement to clean up the data labels.

## Step 3. Merging datasets and adding labels to generate the tidy dataset.
Once the datasets were cleaning based in the requered subset of columns and rows, a join of train and test dataset was done. 

## Section 4. Creating a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
Finally, a new file (dataset) with the average of each veriable for each activity and subject was generated.
