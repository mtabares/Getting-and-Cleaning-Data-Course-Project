This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R does the following. Heather Wade a. Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory b. Load all project dataset: activity,feature, test and train, keeping only columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation c. Loads the activity and subject data for train and test datasets d. Merges the two datasets (merges the selected columns in a full dataset) e. Converts the activity and subject columns into factors f. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair. g. The end result is shown in the file tidy_data.txt.
